---- First Project making DOM manipulation using Vanilla JS only -----

- Simple Game to practice RGB color codes with a few adjustments


i) I give you the RGB code, and 6 options.
ii)Clicking on a wrong option will make that option dissapear, leaving you with one less
iii) Clicking on the right option will notify you of success
iv) Restart button on left

Select difficulty by clicking on appropriate word
   - Easy mode makes a complete random selection of 6 colors 
  
   - Hard mode reduces the range of each R, G and B to +/- 75 from the correct color code


* I do have some issues, listed on top of .js file, any help appreciated.
